                           FUNCTIONS IN TANTRUMS
================================================================================

BASIC INFO: THROWING A TANTRUM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Tantrums, you do not declare a function with `func`, `fn`, `def`, or `void`. 
You do it by throwing a `tantrum`. 

If you want a strictly typed function with a clear return type:
tantrum int add(int a, int b) 
{
    return (a + b);
}

If you want an untyped, dynamic function that just does things:
tantrum greet(string name) 
{
    print("Hello " + name);
}

If you are running in dynamic mode or just don't care, drop the parameter types:
tantrum multiply(a, b) 
{
    return (a * b);
}

You call them just like in any C-based language: `add(5, 10);`. 
The `main()` function is implicitly required at the entry-file level. The VM 
searches for `main()` and kicks off execution there.

ADVANCED INFO: IMPORTS (MODULES & FILES)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can split your code across multiple files using the `use` keyword. It 
functions similarly to `#include` in C++ or `import` in Python. 

Example:
use helper.42AHH;

This statement reads `helper.42AHH`, compiles it, and pushes its global 
variables and functions into the current scope. It imports *everything*. There 
is no namespace isolation yet, so if `helper.42AHH` defines a function `do_math()`, 
you can just call `do_math()` directly in your file. 

Duplicate imports are ignored automatically. The compiler maintains a list of 
resolved file paths. If you `use utils.42AHH` and `utils.42AHH` also contains 
`use math.42AHH`, the compiler won't loop infinitely. It just says, "Hey, I 
already loaded that," and skips the duplicate load. Feel free to `use` your 
files in an infinite tangled spaghetti web. The compiler handles it.

NOTE: Currently, imported files MUST be in the same directory as the main file, 
or you must provide relative paths properly. The module resolution isn't very 
smart yet. It literally relies on C++ `std::ifstream` relative directories.

ADVANCED INFO: BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tantrums provides an array of native functions built directly into the VM in C++.
These do not require an import. They are always available.

`print(x)`
Prints output to the standard C++ output buffer (`std::cout`). It automatically 
formats lists as `[1, 2, 3]` and maps as `{"key": "value"}`.

`len(x)`
Returns the length of a string, list, or map in O(1) time. Since we swapped 
strings to a dynamic buffer recently, `len()` on strings is incredibly fast.

`type(x)`
Returns the type name of the passed variable as a string (e.g., `"int"`, 
`"list"`, `"bool"`). Useful for dynamic type checking.

`append(list, value)`
Mutates a list directly by appending a value. Since lists are dynamic block 
arrays, this triggers amortized geometric capacity doubling behind the scenes 
so you don't stall the thread.

`input("prompt")`
Reads a line of standard input from the user. It halts the execution thread 
until the user presses Enter.

Time APIs: `getCurrentTime()`, `toSeconds(ms)`, `toMinutes(ms)`, `toHours(ms)`
`getCurrentTime()` dips into the C++ `<chrono>` library to return the raw 
Unix Epoch system time explicitly in milliseconds. You can use the other 
methods to format those gigantic integer deltas into human-readable floats.

Memory APIs: `getProcessMemory()`, `getVmMemory()`, `getVmPeakMemory()`
Returns `int` representing exact allocation metrics in bytes natively.

Conversion APIs: `bytesToKB(b)`, `bytesToMB(b)`, `bytesToGB(b)`
Returns strictly converted `float` mathematics instantly without string formatting overhead.

LAUGHS & FACTS: THE CALL STACK & INPUT HACKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Every function call initiates a Call Frame structure in the VM. Our call 
  stack is pre-allocated with a flat array of frames (usually capped at 64 or 
  256 deep, UPDATED: its 16384 frames). If you write a massive recursive function without a base case, 
  the virtual machine will panic with a "Stack Overflow" rather than crashing 
  the host operating system. Safe and cozy!

- `input("prompt")` is hilariously smart. The return type magically depends on
  what variable you are assigning it to!
  
  `int n = input("Enter num: ");`
  This actually parses the user's input as an integer automatically. It runs 
  C++'s `std::stoi()` under the hood. If the user types "hello", no promises 
  on what happens to the VM though.
  
  `bool b = input("Yes? ");`
  The boolean input string parsing logic is legendary. If the user types "true", 
  it returns true. If they type literally ANY letter or digit, it returns true. 
  If they hit Enter blindly, type tabs, or spaces, it returns false. The VM 
  just assumes that if you didn't type text, you meant 'false'. It's lazy user 
  input validation taken to the extreme.

- Missing `main()`? The Lexer and Parser do not actually care if you have a 
  `main()` function. They will compile arbitrary scripts hanging in global space. 
  But the VM execution wrapper insists that it needs to call `main()`. So without 
  it, the bytecode compiles successfully and then the VM finishes execution in 
  -1 milliseconds without failing. We had to build a specific warning into the 
  VS Code extension that screams `NO MAIN FUNC missing wrapper detection` because 
  users kept complaining their code wasn't running.

- There is currently no `return` optimization for tail-recursive functions. If 
  you try to calculate the 1000th Fibonacci sequence number using pure recursion, 
  the compiler will try its best, create massive call frames, push variables, 
  and explode. Use loops. 

- You can't declare anonymous functions or lambdas yet. The parser wasn't 
  designed to handle unnamed `tantrum` blocks, so every function needs an 
  explicit token identifier. Functional programming fans are out of luck.
